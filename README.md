Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! 👩‍💻
This repository highlights my key projects completed during my Data Analyst course and internship, covering real-world datasets, predictive modeling, and business insights.

Each project demonstrates expertise in Python, SQL, Excel, and Machine Learning, along with data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling.

📌 Projects
1. Electric Vehicle Sales by State in India 

Objective: Analyze and predict electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across Indian states.

Key Tasks:

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset (2014–2023) of EV sales.

Performed state-wise, vehicle-type, and category-wise EDA.

Built a Random Forest Regressor to predict EV sales.

Identified key drivers of EV adoption (State, Vehicle Category).

Tools & Skills: Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn), SQL, Excel, Machine Learning.

2. IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition & Performance 

Objective: Uncover factors contributing to employee attrition and performance.

Key Tasks:

Conducted demographic and satisfaction-based EDA.

Calculated attrition rate (16.12%) and average employee tenure (7 years).

Visualized attrition trends by age, gender, department, and job role.

Highlighted relationships between job satisfaction, salary hikes, and attrition.

Tools & Skills: Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), SQL, Excel, HR Analytics.

3. Olympics Data Analysis 

Objective: Explore medal distribution, athlete performance, and country dominance in Olympics (1976–2008).

Key Tasks:

Cleaned and transformed raw Olympic medal data.

Analyzed medal trends by country, gender, and sport.

Identified top athletes (e.g., Michael Phelps with 16 medals).

Built a Logistic Regression model to predict medal wins.

Tools & Skills: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn), Excel, SQL, Predictive Modeling.

4. Uber Trip Analysis 

Objective: Analyze and forecast Uber ride demand using NYC trip datasets (2014–2015).

Key Tasks:

Processed 4.5M+ Uber trips data.

Conducted EDA on trip frequency by hour, weekday, and location.

Trained XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree models.

Achieved 8.37% MAPE with XGBoost; improved stability with ensemble modeling.

Tools & Skills: Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost), Time Series Forecasting, Machine Learning, SQL.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, XGBoost)

Databases: SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Visualization: Excel, Tableau, Power BI

Techniques: Data Cleaning, EDA, Predictive Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, Attrition & HR Analytics
